# DATA :: COMMENTS
Please note, I purposely left the scraped data out. **The code is there for yourself to pull the data in the `notebooks section`.**

I did, however, include the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (“IWD”) entitled `IWD_holdings` as this was provided by the ETF.

**If you can’t code & wish to see the scraped data**, I am happy to share with no associated financial requirements, I would just ask that you agree that I hold no responsibility to you making any financial decisions based on the contents provided; **please read the RISK WARNING**.

Thanks for your understanding.
