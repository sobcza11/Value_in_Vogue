# OVERVIEW
An incredible year in the financial markets last year (2021), including the equity market in the United States (“US”). This said, **slow economic growth & inflation is expected in 2022. Against this backdrop, an outperformance in the defensive sectors may be the result; thus, a move to value equities.**  

# DESCRIPTION
**The purpose of this mini-project is to develop a database of all US listed equities that have had dividends & never lowered them in the past ~30 years; i.e. since January 1990.**  

The inspiration for this mini-project, simply put, is nothing more than answering a question I've had for a while.  

Please note, **this is just one approach to identify value US equities.** There is also an Exchange Traded Fund (“ETF”) called the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (“IWD”) that is structured for value equities.  

Please note, **this is not a comprehensive Data Science or Data Analytics project. As mentioned, it's purpose / structure is purely to answer a question I have had for a little while.**
