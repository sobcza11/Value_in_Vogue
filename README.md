# OVERVIEW
An incredible year in the financial markets last year (2021), including the equity market in the United States (“US”). This said, slow economic growth & inflation is expected to continue in 2022. Against this backdrop, an outperformance in the defensive sectors may be the result; thus, a move to value equities. 

# DESCRIPTION
**The purpose of this mini-project is to develop a database of all US listed equities that have had dividends & never lowered them in the past 30 years; i.e. since January 1990.**

**This is just one approach to identify value US equities.** There is also an Exchange Traded Fund (“ETF”) called the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (“IWD”) that is structured for value equities.
